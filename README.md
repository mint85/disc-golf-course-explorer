## Next Steps:

<br>

This app is currently able to display detailed information about disc golf courses, but lacks the data set necessary to become more robust. Planned future improvements include:

- Use the Disc Golf Course Review API to seed the database with more courses.
- Implement a search by zipcode feature.
- Implement a second model for creating a list of the discs you currently use.
- Implement user authentication
    - Allow authenticated users to add courses to a list of their 'favorites'
    - Allow authenticated users to save their disc bag
