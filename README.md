# Disc Golf Course Explorer

Disc Golf Course Explorer is an application designed to help the user look up new disc golf courses to play. There is detailed information about each course, including course photos. 

Users can edit existing course information, add new courses, and delete courses from the database.

## Getting Started

Deployed App: https://disc-golf-course-explorer.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- JavaScript
- EJS
- HTML

## Next Steps

This app is currently able to display detailed information about disc golf courses, but lacks the data set necessary to become more robust. Planned future improvements include:

- Use the Disc Golf Course Review API to seed the database with more courses.
- Implement a search by zipcode feature.
- Implement a second model for creating a list of the discs you currently use.
- Implement user authentication
    - Allow authenticated users to add courses to a list of their 'favorites'
    - Allow authenticated users to save their disc bag
